# Algorithm with many examples using JS

Here goes the demonstration of some examples for you to use with JavaScript

    In this example we want to show the types of variables `var, let and const`.

    In this example we want to show the dinamic types `number, string, boolean` and primitive types `Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number and String`.

- [3 - Conditions](https://github.com/ExamplesJS/basic/blob/master/3-conditions.js)
   In this example we want to show the conditions and decisions, using the comparators operators `==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >= and <=`, logic operators `&&, || and !` and using conditions to decisions `if, else if, else, ternary and switch`.  

- [4 - Loops and interactions](https://github.com/ExamplesJS/basic/blob/master/4-loops-and-interactions.js)
    Coming soon...

- [5 - Functions](https://github.com/ExamplesJS/basic/blob/master/5-functions.js) 
    Comming soon...

- [6 - Type Object](https://github.com/ExamplesJS/basic/blob/master/6-objects.js)
